                    <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
                    <h2>Ideal</h2>
                    <p>The users will be able to view all the surveys done in Simcoe county by Rudy Mak Surveying Ltd. (RMS) through the ArcGIS Dashboard and web map. With these tools, the staff of the RMS will be able to track surveys based on their due dates, to see which jobs are active and determine which ones to prioritize. </p>
                    <h2>Reality</h2>
                    <p>There is currently no way for RMS to track their surveys without browsing through a huge pile of paperwork or manually sifting through archives to find simple and immediate information on each job.</p>
                    <h2>Consequences</h2>
                    <p>Since there is no readily available tool that shows the active and upcoming surveys, it is difficult to prepare for those surveys that are urgent and monitor all active surveys, to prevent overdue jobs.</p>
                    <h2>Proposal</h2>
                    <p>Temporal tracking of all surveys done in Simcoe county by Rudy Mak Surveying Ltd using a dashboard and web map (and extended interactive mapbox API), that will allow the survey crew to view the due dates of activ and upcoming jobs to make consciencious decision on what jobs to prioritize. The public will also be allowed to view and learn about the ongoing and past jobs done by RMS Ltd.</p>
                    <h2>Technology Used</h2>

            <!-- Methodology -->
            <section>
                <a id="methodology">
                    <h1>Methodology</h1>
                    <p>After retrieving the development applications data from the City of Toronto Open Data Portal, the coordinates were transformed from the original MTM zone 10 projection to UTM zone 17N ground coordinates, using the X Y Table to Point geoprocessing tool in ArcGIS Pro. From this geocoded data, the applications were symbolised according to application type and the layers published to ArcGIS online (AGOL) to create a web map. This web map was the base from which the Dashboard and Experience Builder were created.</p>
                    <p>The dashboard displays the statistical trends of the development applications, and the Experience Builder enhances the cartographic visualisation to give the user a more interactive experience. A story map was also created to show the development application process, so the user can better understand the statistics and other information illustrated by these tools and applications.</p>
                    <p>All tools and applications used are further documented, giving a step-by-step guide into the whole process from conceptualization stage to completion. All achievements and other outcomes are also documented.</p>

                    <h1>Welcome to Development Activity Tracker!</h1>
                    <p>City development is a dynamic process which plays an important role on sustainable growth of modern cities. As Toronto is the largest city in Canada, the amount of development activity within the city is extremely high. There were 76,358 development applications received by the City of Toronto between January 1, 2008 to April 6, 2022. The high amount of development activity can be daunting if people were to look for developments in a certain area without a map. Thus, the City of Toronto is interested in being able to map all the development activities, allowing the public to access detailed information of development applications interactively.</p>
                    <p>To help alleviating the difficulties when researching development activities, Fleming Flamingos has ultilized various ArcGIS Technology to deliver a series of web solutions.</p>
