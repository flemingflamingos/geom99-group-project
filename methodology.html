                    <h1>Methodology</h1>
                    <p>After retrieving the development applications data from the City of Toronto Open Data Portal, the coordinates were transformed from the original MTM zone 10 projection to UTM zone 17N ground coordinates, using the X Y Table to Point geoprocessing tool in ArcGIS Pro. From this geocoded data, the applications were symbolised according to application type and the layers published to ArcGIS online (AGOL) to create a web map. This web map was the base from which the Dashboard and Experience Builder were created.</p>
                    <p>The dashboard displays the statistical trends of the development applications, and the Experience Builder enhances the cartographic visualisation to give the user a more interactive experience. A story map was also created to show the development application process, so the user can better understand the statistics and other information illustrated by these tools and applications.</p>
                    <p>All tools and applications used are further documented, giving a step-by-step guide into the whole process from conceptualization stage to completion. All achievements and other outcomes are also documented.</p>
