                    <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
                    <h2>Ideal</h2>
                    <p>The users will be able to view and track the location, volume, type, and status of development activities within the City of Toronto, using the created dashboard. They can use this information to make decisions on where and when to build, purchase, or lease their homes, businesses, or other structures.</p>
                    <h2>Reality</h2>
                    <p>The required data can only be obtained from the city's open data portal, which is updated monthly. There might be a huge gap where information is missing or not current. Currently, it is difficult to find maps that illustrate devleopment activities in Toronto, and finding a place to settle can be overwhelming.</p>
                    <h2>Consequences</h2>
                    <p>Searching for development activites might be difficult without maps or other visual representations outlining the process, in particular, the volume, location and status.</p>
                    <h2>Proposal</h2>
                    <p>To create a dashboard to spatially and temporally track and display the location, volume, type, and status of all development activities throughout the City of Toronto in real time (or as data is made available). This will considerably reduce the difficulties faced when searching for settlement sites in the area.</p>
                    <h2>Technology Used</h2>
                    <p>ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Dashboards, ArcGIS Experience Builder, ArcGIS StoryMaps</p>
