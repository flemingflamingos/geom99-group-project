                    <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
                    <h2>Ideal</h2>
                    <p>The users will be able to view all the surveys done in Simcoe county by Rudy Mak Surveying Ltd. (RMS) through the ArcGIS Dashboard and web map. With these tools, the staff of the RMS will be able to track surveys based on their due dates, to see which jobs are active and determine which ones to prioritize. </p>
                    <h2>Reality</h2>
                    <p>There is currently no way for RMS to track their surveys without browsing through a huge pile of paperwork or manually sifting through archives to find simple and immediate information on each job.</p>
                    <h2>Consequences</h2>
                    <p>Since there is no readily available tool that shows the active and upcoming surveys, it is difficult to prepare for those surveys that are urgent and monitor all active surveys, to prevent overdue jobs.</p>
                    <h2>Proposal</h2>
                    <p>Temporal tracking of all surveys done in Simcoe county by Rudy Mak Surveying Ltd using a dashboard and web map (and extended interactive mapbox API), that will allow the survey crew to view the due dates of activ and upcoming jobs to make consciencious decision on what jobs to prioritize. The public will also be allowed to view and learn about the ongoing and past jobs done by RMS Ltd.</p>
